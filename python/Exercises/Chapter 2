Exercise 2: Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them.
Enter your name: Chuck
Hello Chuck


Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.
Enter Hours: 35 Enter Rate: 2.75 Pay: 96.25
We won’t worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.


Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment state- ments:

width = 17 
height = 12.0

For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).
1. width//2 
2. width/2.0 
3. height/3 
4. 1 + 2 * 5
Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.


Exercise 5: Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius tem- perature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature.
